# Shi Kong Xing Shou (時空星獸)
This is a disassembly of Shi Kong Xing Shou, an obscure Pokémon/Digimon-esque game developed by Vast Fame.
It uses the sound engine from Mega Man V and assets from Pokémon, Telefang and likely many more games; although there is a lot of original and interesting content here too.

It builds the following ROM:
- [**shi_kong_xing_shou.gbc**](https://archive.org/download/shi-kong-xing-shou/Shi%20Kong%20Xing%20Shou.gbc) `MD5: 24e73734490ad40f9d8228a80ff15c0b`
(baserom is required)
